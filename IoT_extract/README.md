IoT_Devices_Related_Vulnerabilities_Extraction

Originally created by Wei Zhang and modifed by Xuanyu Duan.

We download vulnerability recoirds from NVD and merger all the files into one file(all.csv). The 'all.csv' is too big to upload to Github, so I upload it to Google Drive(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sz6GjiGAYaWK6KtagvFmb-xDfdWpqGgM/view?usp=sharing). Extractions are made based on the all vulnerabilities records that takes consideration of both product names and descriptions.
